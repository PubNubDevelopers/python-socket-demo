# Sockets with Python

This repository contains example code for exchanging data between a client and server over Python sockets:
- `client.py`
- `server.py`

Code examples are also given for exchanging data between two Python clients directly using PubNub:
- `pn_client_1.py`
- `pn_client_2.py`

## Running the Code (Python sockets)
- [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Clone this repo to your machine
- `python3 server.py`
- `python3 client.py` (in a separate terminal)
